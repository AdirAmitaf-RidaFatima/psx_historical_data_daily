## How to Use This in Google Colab

> You donâ€™t need to install anything locally â€” it runs 100% online!

### Step 1: Open the Notebook
Open the Google Colab notebook (or copy this script into a new notebook).

### Step 2: Set Your Date Range
At the top of the code, adjust:
python <br>
- start_date = datetime.strptime('2025-07-20', '%Y-%m-%d')
- end_date = datetime.strptime('2025-07-25', '%Y-%m-%d') 
Set any range of dates you want to scrape. <br>

### Step 3: Run All Cells
Click Runtime > Run All or run cells one by one. The script will:<br>
- Scrape each date (excluding weekends)
- Log which days were scraped
- Skip days with no data (like holidays)
- Save the full data to psx_data.csv

Step 4: Download CSV
After scraping is complete, download the psx_data.csv file from the Colab file browser on the left panel.

### Features
- Fully automated scraping 
- Supports scraping for any valid date range
- Skips weekends and market-closed days
- Saves data in clean tabular format
- Beginner-friendly and well-commented code

### Technologies Used
- Python
- requests â€“ for HTTP requests
- BeautifulSoup â€“ for parsing HTML
- datetime â€“ for date range logic
- csv â€“ for exporting data

### Limitations
- The PSX website may change its structure in the future. This script is based on its current HTML layout.
- This script does not use Selenium, so it might not work if the site becomes fully JavaScript-based.
- Data may not be available for weekends or public holidays â€” those days are automatically skipped.
